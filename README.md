# Container Exporter (CXP)

A resource-friendly, highly efficient, and minimal Prometheus exporter to track memory and CPU usage of Docker containers along with their lifecycle (uptime)

## How to use

### Before You start
 - Port 8000 must be open
 - Docker & Docker Compose should be installed (optional)
 - The presence of Git and Python3

### Getting started
- clone and enter the repository using the following commands:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shayan-Ghani/Container-exporter.git
  cd container-exporter
```
- Deploy the docker-compose file that suits you the best for instance :
```bash 
# make the file executable
  chmod +x ./start.sh

# with docker compose v1
  docker-compose -f container-exporter.yml up -d

# Or using v2
  docker compose -f container-exporter.yml up -d
```

#### Can't use Docker? Ok then :
```bash
# No need if done already
  chmod +x ./start.sh

# install the required python packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

# add & at the end to launch in the background
  ./start.sh 

``` 

### Add CXP to Prometheus
- Edit your `prometheus.yml` file and add the address of container-exporter in scrape_configs:

![Prometheus config](./capture/scrape-config.png "Prometheus configuration file")

- Reload or restart your Prometheus server.
### That is it you are good to go, Enjoy Using CXP! "}"
