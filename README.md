## Step-by-Step Guide

### Before You start
 - Port 8000 must be open (default port)
 - Docker & Docker Compose should be installed (optional)
 - The presence of Git and Python3

### Getting started
- clone and enter the repository using the following commands:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shayan-Ghani/Container-exporter.git
  cd container-exporter
```
- Deploy the docker-compose file that suits you the best for instance :
```bash 
# Make the file executable
  chmod +x ./start.sh

# With docker compose v1
  docker-compose -f container-exporter.yml up -d

# Or using v2
  docker compose -f container-exporter.yml up -d
```

#### Can't use Docker? Ok then :
```bash
# No need if done already
  chmod +x ./start.sh

# Set up virtualenv
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -U pip

# Install the required python packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add & at the end to launch in the background
  ./start.sh 

``` 

### Add CXP to Prometheus
- Edit your `prometheus.yml` file and add the address of container-exporter in scrape_configs:

![Prometheus config](./capture/scrape-config.png "Prometheus configuration file")

- Reload or restart your Prometheus server and reachout to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics`
### That is it you are good to go, Enjoy Using CXP! "}"

## Grafana Dashboards
Check out [dashboards](./dashboards) directory for json files. including CPU & Memomory usage + containers status (uptime).

**Change `Your prometheus data source uid` with the uid of prometheus data source uid. you can find it this way:** 
- Reach out to Grafana then enter  `Home > Administration > Data sources`  then click on your Prometheus data source.
- the characters after `datasources/edit/` is your uid. (e.g datasources/edit/**c8e586ac-4262-4aad5-a103-1240ss826424**)

- alternatively, use `dashboard-gen.sh` script to change the dashboards uid by providing the uid as the first argument of the script. do the following steps:

```
 cd scripts && bash dashboard-gen.sh <your uid> 
```
- replace `<your uid>` with your actual prometheus datasource uid. 

- now head to grafana dashboards and hit `new > import` then copy the dashboard json file and paste it into `Import via panel json`

- hit the `load` button and Done!
